1. Retrieve IP address from DDOS and DOS attacks
2. Compare source code of malicious files to github projects to find the writer
3. Record webcam footage of attackers (preferably blackmailable content)
4. Easy to use Interface
5. Timer

Informative Guy, get started on cyber security

Steps to make this happen:

Step 1. Get in tune with the industry and maintain this step at least until you get a job.
Start listening to Darknet Diaries. This will prepare your brain for what's possible and "let you in" on all the different crazy stuff that happens around the world. You'll learn about attacks you never thought possible and you'll get exposure to all different kinds of crazy situations all around the world. If you like it, try to listen to all the episodes.

To complement DND, start listening to a daily cyber news source, such as The CyberWire by Dave Bittner and crew. This is a highly produced, curated news source for cyber security events all around the world. Listening to this will improve your vernacular and keep you in tune with the industry and latest events. Consistently listening to this a lot will pay off a lot come time your interview. Not only will you know about all kinds of recent events, but you'll be able to articulate yourself using industry terms much better than if you had not been listening.

Huntress labs or the hacker news, etc

Step 2. Gain basic computing and security knowledge along with some basic programming skills
This step can be a bit tough because Cybersecurity builds on IT, so you have to have somewhat of a base in IT knowledge before you can really be effective in security. While this step is hard, it's by no means insurmountable.
I would recommend the following the following curriculum to get started:
CompTIA Network+,  and CompTIA Security+. You don't necessarily need to get the certifications, but I would honestly recommend at least getting Security+.
I would also STRONGLY recommend learning the basics of a programming/scripting language. Nothing too rigorous. I personally recommend CodeWithMosh' python course.
He has a free course on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc
Use google and figure out how to create a simple program with your python skills, such as a simple port scanner or ping sweeper. Publish this to your Github.com account.
Put all of these things on your resume
A degree can satisfy this step, however it's not required
